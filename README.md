# terraform-cloudwatch

Terraform module to setup cloudwatch alerts and push them to SNS. This repository contains the following modules:

* `api-gateway`: Creates general alerts for the api-gateway.
* `dynamodb`: Creates the alerts needed for a dynamodb table.
* `kinesis`: Creates alerts for a kinesis stream. This is used in the `skyscrapers/terraform-kinesis` module.
* `lambda_function`: Creates the alerts for lambda functions.

## API-Gateway

Creates general alerts for the API-Gateway

The following resources are created:

* Cloudwatch alerts for the API-Gateway that was passed as variable
